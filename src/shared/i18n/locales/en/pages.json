      "title": "How it works and why it helps",
      "description": "The method «<strong>enter income → set goals → categorize expenses → use envelopes</strong>» turns money from an abstraction into a clear plan: you see how much comes in, where it goes, which goals are more important, and what limits each category has. This reduces anxiety, eliminates «leaks» and gives a sense of control."
    },
    "section1": {
      "title": "1) Enter income → understand the real base",
      "why": "without honest income accounting, any plans are «in the air».",
      "what": "a fixed framework (monthly/annual) from which limits and goal deadlines are calculated.",

    "section4": {
      "title": "4) Envelope method → turn plan into behavior",
      "why": "an «envelope» (category limit) turns intention into action.",
      "how": "each category is assigned a strict limit; you can't spend beyond it, but you can consciously redistribute between envelopes.",
      "result": "the budget becomes a self-limiting system — no need to «calculate in your head» all the time.",
      "inAppTitle": "In the app:",
